## Hyperbolic Discord Chatbot Guide

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to help guide you on how you can use the Hyperbolic API to create a Discord chat bot and interact with them with more ease.

With a VPS or Gitpod, you will be able to run this with ease. I've backtested it to see it's easy to follow.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot

Run the bot using **Node.js**:

node index.js
```

Run the bot with PM:

first install pm

npm install -g pm2
```

Then use PM2 

```bash

```

To check logs using PM2:

Now create a server after creating your bot and invite the bot to try it out!

## How to best get the bot invite 

Go to the sidebar the devloper webbsite where you are creating the bot; https://discord.com/developers/applications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**

Please, this is a rough tryout; be careful to reset your API keys. 

Worked on this because I know some of us like Discord way better than telegram

Goodluck!
